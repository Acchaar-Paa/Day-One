def boost(x):
    return x * 2


# File: mission.py
# Your task: Import boost from logic_tools.py and call it with value 7.
# BUT — you can only import the function itself (no full module import)
# Write the full correct code for mission.py.
# If it would fail, it must fail cleanly — no hidden errors allowed.
